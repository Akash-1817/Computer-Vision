# Computer-Vision

This project is a comprehensive collection of core computer vision techniques implemented from scratch and with the help of popular libraries. It serves as both a learning resource and a practical toolbox for image processing and analysis.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Image Conversion (Grayscale, Binary, etc.)
- ✅ Histogram Equalization
- ✅ Color Models (RGB, HSV, YCrCb, etc.)
- ✅ Image Transformations (Scaling, Rotation, Affine, Perspective)
- ✅ Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
- ✅ Image Filtering (Low-pass, High-pass, Gaussian, etc.)
- ✅ Image Restoration
- ✅ Edge Detection (Sobel, Canny, etc.)
- ✅ Object Detection
- ✅ Image Segmentation
- ✅ Background Subtraction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
